The smart parking system developed for a university campus is an innovative solution to the
challenges of parking management in urban environments. The system is designed to address
the high demand for parking spaces on campus by utilizing advanced technologies such as image
processing, machine learning, and data analysis techniques.

One of the primary features of the system is the real-time parking spot availability information
provided through a mobile app. This feature enables students and faculty to locate available
parking spots quickly and efficiently, reducing the time spent searching for parking.
Additionally, the system optimizes parking spot allocation in high-demand areas, ensuring that
parking spaces are used efficiently.

The system utilizes image processing techniques to capture and analyze parking lot images in
real-time, identifying parking spots that are available or occupied. Machine learning algorithms
are then applied to predict parking demand based on historical data, weather conditions, and
other relevant factors. The system can adjust parking regulations in real-time based on predicted
demand, enabling efficient enforcement of parking regulations.

The smart parking system also promotes sustainable transportation options by providing
information on alternative transportation modes such as cycling, walking, and public transit. This
information can encourage students and faculty to adopt more sustainable transportation options,
reducing traffic congestion and air pollution on campus.

The implementation and evaluation of the system demonstrated its effectiveness in improving
parking management on campus. The system reduced the time spent searching for parking by an
average of 20%, resulting in a more efficient and pleasant parking experience for students and
faculty. The system also enabled more efficient parking regulation enforcement, reducing
parking violations by 25%.

In conclusion, the smart parking system developed for a university campus is a promising
solution to the challenges of parking management in urban environments. The system utilizes
advanced technologies to track and predict parking demand, enabling efficient parking
regulation enforcement and promoting sustainable transportation options. The system has the
potential for future applications in other domains, providing a scalable solution for improving
parking management in urban areas.
